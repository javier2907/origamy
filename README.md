### What is Orgamy?

The main idea of ​​this project is to be able to render html in a simple and integrated way in PHP as one more class with its respective functions, taking advantage of the power of object-oriented programming.

We also want to help avoid the spaghetti code that is generated by mixing php and html in the same document.

In the future it will be possible to integrate CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, Material and many more.
